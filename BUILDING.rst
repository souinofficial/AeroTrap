Building AeroTrap
===================

This is basic documentation on how to build AeroTrap from source, with commands.

Dependencies
------------

This wont be is accurate to what is needed to be installed for it to build succesfully,
but more so the acknowlegable ones.

It is way easier if you are on macOS or Linux to just use Nix, and enter the flake devshell with

.. code-block:: bash

   nix develop

and if you get prompted to trust nix configuraiton stuff, you can deny if you don't feel it's safe.

macOS Specific
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Xcode (.app is preferred as it has the whole toolchain which is needed)
- Xcode Command Line Tools

Windows Specific
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- NSIS (need to add the NSIS compiler to PATH env, which can be found via searching "Edit System Environment Variables")

All other dependents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Rust compiler (Rust 2024, and preferrably though rustup)
- .NET 10 SDK (Need a C# compiller)
- Fallout dotnet tool (build ochestration system)
- Git (needed by Fallout & our orchestration to publish with a version, which is nedeed to publish)

Commands
--------

Publish
~~~~~~~

Publishing is going to create installers, and other important stuff making it publishable online.

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet run --project build -- publish

and to publish without the installers- e.g packaging for your own system which doesn't need them

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet run --project build -- publish --no-installers

Cross-compiling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``publish`` and ``compile`` take an ``--override-arch`` flag (``x64`` or ``arm64``) which
forces the entire build to target that architecture instead of the hosts one- so dotnet
gets the matching runtime identifier, the rust backend gets built for the matching target
triple, and the Xcode macOS app is built with the matching ``ARCHS``.

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet run --project build -- publish --override-arch x64

This is how the Intel package is produced from an Apple Silicon machine, and vice versa.

Build
~~~~~

Going to be useful for debug builds, and there's mulitple ways to do so.

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet run --project build -- compile

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet build

Clean
~~~~~

Cleaning out stale stuff- should run both of these.

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet run --project build -- clean

.. code-block:: bash

   dotnet clean

Directories
-----------

Most likely your at this section to figure out where fallout build stuff goes-
and that is ``/.build``.

- ``.build/publish`` - a publish artifact dir where from ``dotnet publish`` everything useful gets put into
- ``.build/build`` - a directory for non-publish builds
- ``.build/dist`` - a directory for all things that can be distributed (macOS does have .app in there though, which is never signed)
